## [Week 2](https://learnit.itu.dk/pluginfile.php/310604/mod_resource/content/0/Exercises%20%2302.pdf)

This week, I've learned the basics of the kotlin language and solved exercises in the repository:
https://github.com/joglr/kotlin/blob/main/exercise02.kts

I've also added a README for instructions to setup the kotlin compiler. It can be used in script mode using the `run.bat` script.

## [Week 3](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/resource/view.php?id=149657)

This week we have added multiple activities in the Scooter Sharing app. We learned to used databindings, so findViewById calls are no longer necesessary
